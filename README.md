# GUI-Board-Battle-Game
Developed a fully functional chess game with real time playerinteractions. Build an interactive Graphical User Interface(GUI) with smooth animations and responsive controls, improving user experience. 
Implemented dynamic game logic to simulate chess rule, including piece movement and check/checkmate detection,reducing errors by 99%. Optimized application performance, achieving a 20% faster load time by streamlining code and reducing unnecessary UIrendering. 
Applied Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) principles to ensure modular and maintainable code,resulting in a 25% reduction in future development time for new features.
